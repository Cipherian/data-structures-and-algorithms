## Functionality

- First repeated word method:

  - Uses a dictionary/hashing to store data

  - Uses regex to filter words in the parameter

  - Splits those words up

  - Iterates through the split words

  - If the word is in the dictionary then it returns that word

  - Otherwise it adds that word to the dictionary

  - If there is no repeating words it returns None
