# Hashmap Left Join

- Author: Daniel Brott

- Code: [Hashmap_left_join](../hashmap_left_join/)

- Whiteboard: [Hashmap_Whiteboard](./images/left_join.jpg)

## Code Functionality

- First declare a function with two hashmaps as a parameter

- Then declare variable to an empty list

- Then iterate through the keys in the first hashmap

- Get the value from map1 and map2's current key

- If there is no matching value assign it to None instead

- append to the list a tuple containing the key, the first hashmaps current key value and the second hashmaps current key value

- return the resulting list
