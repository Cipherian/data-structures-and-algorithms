- 10/15/2022

## Challenge

- Create a linked list class and node class and pass the provided tests

## Approach & Efficiency

- Traversing the linked list is O(n) time.

## API

- insert which adds a node at the head of the linked list

- `__str__` prints a string representation of the linked_list class

- "includes" checks if the current value is equal to the value passed in the parameter and returns true.
